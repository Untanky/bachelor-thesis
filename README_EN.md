## File structure

The root directoriy (it contains this `README`) is the project origin.

The frontend developed to access the interfaces can be found in the directory `frontend`.

The implemented interfaces can be found in the directory `backend`.

Information and data relating to database can be retrieved from the directory `database`.

Each of these directories has it's own `README`, which gives more information to the contents of the directories.

The root directory contains a `docker-compose.yaml`](/docker-compose.yaml) which will build and start the different components.
